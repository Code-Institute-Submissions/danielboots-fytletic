## üßë‚Äçüé® **UX:** **User Experience Design (UX)**

 __Developed from the coding institute full stack web developer module on UX design.__

**What is UX:**

User Experience Design is the work, processes and skillsets involved in creating useful useable products which provide value not only to the customer but the business owner ensuring that a product not only works but is intuitive, simple, and enjoyable to use. A good UX experience is achieved by following a defined process called User Centred Design or UCD for short.

I have chosen to create a Fight network with ecommerce and full C.R.U.D functionality and also login and registration forms, following best practice UX principals and will apply them to reassess the current needs and wants of my customers and future potential clients.
