## üßë‚Äçüé® **UX:** **User Experience Design (UX)**

 __Developed from the coding institute full stack web developer module on UX design.__

**What is UX:**

User Experience Design is the work, processes and skillsets involved in creating useful useable products which provide value not only to the customer but the business owner ensuring that a product not only works but is intuitive, simple, and enjoyable to use. A good UX experience is achieved by following a defined process called User Centred Design or UCD for short.

I have chosen to create a Fight network with ecommerce and full C.R.U.D functionality and also login and registration forms, following best practice UX principals and will apply them to reassess the current needs and wants of my customers and future potential clients.

It will have the ability for users to register to the site upload their fighter data and create gyms if they own such facilities. 

With this full stack project i aim to cover all user stories and cover all of the planes of UX and development.



## üí° **Strategy plane: The Initial idea.**
___
The basis behind Fytletic was to create a full stack Django web app which allows established and upcoming fighters from all disciplines a place to register their details online to create a fighter community and network. 

It‚Äôs prime function is to  provide a simple profile that fighters can create for themselves and keep it updated with all essential criteria linked to their profile(criteria which will be addressed in my models and schemas later). Creating a user based personal online fight CV. 
Not only that but Gym owners can create specific gym listings, showcasing their skills, facilities, opening hours and even link to fighters who train there.

A function which will be initially built in the first phase of production will also be a news center of sorts which registered users will be able to read, information will include nutrition advice, training tips, fight news and more. The data will be blocked for unregistered users however a small snippet somewhat like Medium may be enforced in order to encourage people to sign up to the site. 

The over all goal of the site is to become the worlds largest database of fighters, fight gyms and fight/Athelete information. 

There will be a merchandise shop and system in place using technologies for payment Gateway for example stripe. The webshop will track orders and link them to individuals profiles. Initially this service isnt needed to create the MVP however for an example of my developement skills i will include these models for this project version. 


As a developer and from a development standpoint my primary aim is to bring together many of the technologies I have learned so far to then use these technologies and comprehensively display data in a comprehensive and easy to digest manner. I aim to bring in user-generated data using forms (through an Add gym or fighter form page using Django FORMS) and python linked to Postrgres. Thus highlighting the many skills I have obtained during this course. 

 By completing a fully functioning profiling site, I will have demonstrated my experience in developing a Python-based web application with CRUD functionality.


 ## **About the business:**

The web application will be entirely online and is concerned with real-life professional and amateur fight profiles from users who can sign up to the site for zero cost to themselves, simply by registering for an account. The primary aim of the website is to display fight and gym profiles from users and allow them to display their achievements / stats and information to accomplish two things, 1. Exponential growth through sharing of the website and 2. Expand awareness of their profile as an athlete and fighter. This may be from using the web app to connect and reach out to other fighters, or use it as an online 'CV' to showcase their statistics. 

**Strategy to deliver above.**

* A clear and simple design starting with the Hero section displaying the Name and tag line to establish the message of the site.
In this case FYTLETIC - Professional Fight Network.


**Branding:**
* I own the domain name https://fytletic.com and my business name follows suit with the strapline and business idea name. Fytletic is a play on two words , Fighting and Athletic. I beleive Fytletic is an easily rememberable name which translates well to a brand name.

* Logo - will be a simple design based on the letter F and L . Or will be based simply on the business name of Fytletic.

**Strategy to deliver above.**

All of the below points should fulfil 'user first impressions' (see table below) and is especially important in our B2C business.

*	Develop a logo ‚Äì which is simple but effective, based on the letters F and L  and try to symbolise a link between fitness, wellbeing and the relationship of the letters. See Logo on the deployed site for the final design. The logo will also act as a link back to the home page as common practice. Increasing credibility and trustworthiness.
After some developement, i have found that the best option for the logo is to use the Fytletic play on words, using a combination of Bold italic and thin variations of the ‚ÄúMontserrat‚Äù font, which subsequently is also used as the main type face of the web app, i feel this works as it adds to the simlistic approach to the branding of the site.

* A simple design structure with a navigation bar and side navigation on smaller screen resolutions accessible on every page will be essential for allowing users and readers to 'learn' the site and layout/functionality with ease. There should also be a home button/link on the logo for each page and subsequent back/return to the fighters and gyms profile. I will ensure that a back button is generated on each page so that the user doesn't have to use the browser back button as this is bad UX. 

*	Develop a professional colour scheme ‚Äì check out competitors in not only UFC but other athletic based business websites. Use consistently throughout the site. For this colour scheme, I have gone with a dark blue and greys signifying trust, honesty and dependability, therefore helping to build customer and userbase loyalty, i also feel like i wanted the site to come across as a professional body. 

* I have also researched colour palettes and other brands before making any decisions on my final approach you can find that here: 


* **[PDF- Colour Pallete research.](LINK):**


*	Choose a font type for the project which reflects what we are trying to achieve ‚Äì research other platforms and use similar fonts.  ‚ÄúMontserrat‚Äù  will be used consistently throughout this site. The logo and business name  will employ ‚ÄòMontserrat font‚Äô consistently. Again I have used this method from my previous milestone projects as I feel in my portfolio I wish to create a style for myself, following on from similar design and practices.

*	Utilise the bootstrap card and grid system to display the user's fight and gym data in a logical and easy to ‚Äòlearn‚Äô manner.

*	Develop a footer with info section or simple copyright info bar.


| User first impressions        | How to achieve          |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| **_Does it look credible and trustworthy?_**  | Yes ‚Äì through the colour palette, fonts,  logo, social proof of good quality control and reviews. |
| **_Does it offer what I want?_**  | Yes ‚Äì Simple use of CRUD functionality and achieves only what is intended, users the ability to register to the site, add fighters, gym data and also edit and delete that data. Readers of the site can view fighter stats and gym data on the home page and view extended versions of the individual generated templated pages , with easy access back to the main home page and or relevant sections of the site they are on. |
| **_Does it look valuable enough for me to stay?_**  |.Professional design, clear and simple navigation, displayed is an easy to read manner. Mobile responsive. |
| **_Does it look valuable enough for me to return?_**  | Yes, free to use but professional design, deployed on a secure platform, quick responsiveness and easy to 'learn' with all features of a review site available |
| **_What actions can I take now?_**  | Users who aren't logged in will see a clear navigation item which says 'register' and also registered users will see an enhanced menu structure to allow them to use the site effectively |
| **_How do I learn more?_**  | An F.A.Q section on the site will be made available in the footer section to allow users to find the answers to their questions with relative ease  |
| **_How do I contact someone?_**  | Footer provides direct contact details for the webmaster. Similarly, a web form can be accessed from a menu item called 'Contact'|


**What is culturally appropriate**

As this is primarlily a fighter and gym network  I have found that the brand name stands for a lot right from the offset. Our website is only concerned with displaying information within the fight (for example UFC / Boxing) industry, and the fitness industry. We will not be extending our reach in to other similar industries for example cooking (which may be related to nutrition and fitness)


We keep the site strictly about professional organised and amateur fighting  and focus solely on providing the users with the ability to create their professional online CVS , edit and delete them. They will also be able to build up their name as an athlete and fighter. 
By giving the user the ability to update their own profiles, it is encouraging to the user to frequent the site and keep the data being stored about them up to date, including contact details, fight statistics training regimes etc. So again allowing us to create a self building site of relevant user generated content. Not only that but by building on a Django base alongside python we can ensure that we can consistently keep adding improvments and features which users may want and request, for example a follow or messaging service, this allowing users to contact each other and stay on the platform.

I have also developed the site to be mobile-first as our demographic for clients looking for our services seems to be in the male category and age range of 16-34, whereby we know its highly likely that users have access to a smartphone and will be accessing our website from mobile.



**Tracking and cataloguing content in an intuitive way.**

Regarding the display of the content I have opted for a typical section style layout to the site, this meaning I have a hero section and subsequent blocks of content each separated by alternating background colours, an off white and white to ensure content separation is apparent. 

The use of Djngo /Python for loops will allow the display of user generated content in a card, each iteration will generate a new card with the subsequent fighter name image and more button. In time I may break these loops down to fighter Discipline specific headings, for example Boxing, UFC  and even make fighters and gyms searchable by these extended options, however as the site is in its infancy I have opted to generate all reviews in cards utilising the bootstrap grid system displaying no more than three cards per row, time permitting i may employ a pagination system, instead of generating long loops of data.

Typically in modern web design, a hero section is employed so I have taken advantage of that with a centred H1 and H2 Heading for the site title and strapline, using a more bolded font to make an impact from the first-page load. This screams to the user, this is the site title and this is what you can do here.

I also used a background image which is relevant (in this case a glove on rope) to display the field the website is addressing (fighting /combat of some description). One concern is that on fighter profiles, if a user uploads a  bright image it may distract  from the Hero text, so a background overlay maybe used in order to fix this. At present i havent employed this on user generated data however with keeping to the branding pallete of the site i have employed an overlay system on the main navigation hero sections.  Not only that but the background overlay is the main colour in the colour palette chosen again adding to our branding and overall UX experience for the potential client.

**What is the importance of this.**

* From the first time the user visits the website we want to display a level of professionalism and ease of use, not only that our straplines, branding and colour palettes are correct but our content is distraction-free and displayed easily enough that a user can learn about our website and feel at ease very quickly. 

* With minimal distractions and a simple interface, it will become easy for the user to quickly learn the site and sign up for an account and start creating custom content for the site. 

**Why would a user want this.**

 Its important to quickly allow the user to learn the site sign up and create content with little distractions as possible. I have deliberately simplified the application to allow for this. After re watching the sections on development of software i have become well aware of the YAGNI  and KISS principles, this i have designed the site to be deliberatly simple and learned easily by any kind of user.  Typically a user from visiting the site can sign up and create their fighter profile in less than 5 steps. 

1. Visit the application 
2. Click Register
3. Register account.
4. Click claim fighter profile. / gym profile (limited to one fighter and gym profile per registered user.)
5. View Published profile. 

This ease of use and free registration will encourage return users to the platform and again allow users to grow through external content creation. 


**What creates a good User Experience concerning this online Fighter and gym profile business.**

*	Strong branding ‚Äì colour palette ‚Äì typical industry typography.
*	Displaying relevant content. - From only hosting/allowing correct and verified data from users and displaying content which is of value to readers.
*	Social proof ‚Äì adding social sharing to all fight and gym submissions allows for users to share their profiles and in return increases traffic to our web application.
*   Overall ease of use, as highlighted above, the 5 steps from learning the site to publishing is imperative. I have used previous sites which require far more effort and are often more complicated to learn. Simplicity is key.


**What does the user/client expect?**

*	Strong Branding- Does this website come across as an authority in its field. I feel this is true by the use of correctly structured content, branding font type and also consistency throughout.
*	Pricing ‚Äì This is completely free, we may in our terms allow free use to contact users at a later date to offer other premium services. 
*	Ease of use? - 5 steps from initial visit to signing up and publishing the first review.
* Support - this is currently only available from a contact form, however as the site is simple and efficient I believe this is a minor addition to the free service provided. 



**Prioritisation ‚Äì To launch a Minimal Viable Product.**

We can address which features should be prioritised primarily by developing a map of importance and viability/ feasibility.
For this project, we will be focusing on UX efforts of higher importance and developing features of lower importance and viability/feasibility further in the timeline of this project.


| Opportunity/Problem       | Importance         | Viability  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| **_A.     Allow users to register and create publishing account_**       | 5 | 5 |
| **_B.     Display each review on their own page_**      | 5      |   5 |
| **_C.     develop a follow /twitter type system for users to follow each other_** | 3      |    2 |
| **_D.     _** | 2      |    3 |
| **_E.     Group fight profiles to categories_** | 3      |    2 |


**Graph of importance to launch our MVP from the previous table.**

![Fytletic MVP prioritisation ](###)


As referencing the above prioritisation matrix my UX efforts will be hence focused on areas A and B which will satisfy the CRUD app criteria of the grading process. 
Thus I will develop the application to allow users to register and create their accounts whilst also displaying their profiles for fighters and gyms.
